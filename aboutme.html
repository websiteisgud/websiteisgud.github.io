    <p>Hello, I am Nguyen Trac and I am a Freshmen at Citrus Valley High School. Nguyen is a 20-year-old tradesperson's assistant who enjoys binge-watching boxed sets, competitive dog grooming and praying. He is stable and caring, but can also be very cowardly and a bit impatient.

He is a British Christian. He started college but never finished the course. He is obsessed with Donald Trump.

Physically, Keith is in good shape. He is short with fair skin, ginger hair and blue eyes. He has a tattoo of Donald Trump on his lower back.

He grew up in an upper class neighbourhood. He was raised in a happy family home with two loving parents.

He is currently single. His most recent romance was with a scientist called Parker Lois Evans, who was 5 years older than him. They broke up because Parker felt Keith was too closed to new ideas.</p>
