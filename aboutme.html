        <p>Hello, I am Nguyen Trac and I am a Freshmen at Citrus Valley High School. 
        I am 13 years old and went to Cram Elementary and Beattie Middle School. Was borned in 2004 in Fountain Valley. Lived in Rancho Cucamonga and moved to Highland when I turned 5.
        I enjoy playing video games on my  computer at home but mostly online with other people. Some of my favorite games are Overwatch, Team Fortress 2, G-Mod, and some Leauge of Legends.
